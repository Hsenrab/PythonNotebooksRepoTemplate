# Implementation Steps

Follow the "Step-by-Step Plan" in `specification.md`. Use the copilot instructions for style and approach.

## Process:
1. **Identify**: Next incomplete step in specification.md state to the user. A step is a single bullet point.
2. **Clarify**: Ask any questions needed before implementing
3. **Implement**: Make minimal, educational changes for that step
4. **Test**: Run relevant tests and report results
5. **Manual Check**: Suggest manual testing steps for user to verify
6. **Pause**: MANDATORY pause - wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding
7. **Verify**: Only mark âœ… in specification.md after user confirms completion
8. **Continue**: Move to next step only after user approval

## Testing Guidelines:
- **Always suggest manual verification steps** for each step
- Provide specific commands users can run to test
- Include expected outputs and common failure scenarios
- Validate that changes integrate with existing components

## Remember:
- Educational focus over completeness
- Simple, template-ready code
- One step at a time
- **NEVER mark phases complete without user confirmation**
- Ask clarifying questions if anything is unclear
- Suggest manual testing before moving forward
