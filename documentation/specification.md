# Python Notebooks Repository Template - Specification

## Overview

This project aims to create a simple, educational repository template that demonstrates best practices for creating and maintaining Jupyter notebooks intended for sharing with others. The template serves as a learning resource for notebook creators who need to ensure their content remains functional, professional, and up-to-date for external consumption.

## Goals

1. **Shareable Quality**: Provide patterns for creating notebooks that maintain professional standards
2. **Maintainability**: Demonstrate practices that keep shared notebooks functional over time
3. **Collaboration Ready**: Showcase approaches that work well in team environments
4. **Template Reusability**: Create a foundation that can be easily copied and adapted for different sharing scenarios

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Authentication
- âœ… **Implemented**: Azure authentication using `azure_auth_helper.py` module
- âœ… **User-based authentication**: Leverages Azure Identity library with user permissions (no API keys)
- âœ… **Multiple auth methods**: Browser authentication and device code authentication
- âœ… **Credential caching**: Uses DefaultAzureCredential for existing token reuse
- âœ… **Service Usage**: No Azure services in initial examples, only basic chat with Azure AI Foundry SDK and OpenAI model after authentication
- Demonstrate secure credential management through environment variables
- Show integration with Azure AI Foundry services

#### Environment Management
- Create `.env` file structure for environment variables
- Demonstrate separation of configuration from code
- Show secure handling of sensitive information

#### Python Virtual Environment
- âœ… **Package Selection**: Absolute minimum packages - only essential tools plus most recent stable Azure SDKs
- Provide virtual environment configuration using venv and requirements.txt
- Include essential packages for data science workflows plus Azure SDK components
- Include testing tools: pytest, nbmake
- Ensure reproducible environment setup across different machines

#### Notebook Cleaning
- Implement automated notebook cleaning using nbconvert
- Set up git hooks to clean notebooks before commits
- Remove output cells and metadata automatically

#### Notebook Testing
- âœ… **Framework Selected**: Use pytest with nbmake for notebook execution testing
- âœ… **Complexity Level**: Minimal complexity - single-purpose notebooks focusing on one concept each
- âœ… **Documentation Style**: Thorough topic coverage in labeled blocks, minimal repetition, brief inline comments
- âœ… **CI Strategy**: Initial implementation excludes Azure authentication, add Azure authentication testing to GitHub Actions when auth phase is implemented
- Demonstrate automated notebook execution and validation
- Show how to test notebook execution end-to-end
- Include examples of data validation and assertion patterns within notebooks
- Set up GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Simplicity**: Code should be self-explanatory with minimal documentation
- **Educational Value**: Each component should clearly demonstrate a specific best practice
- **Minimal Complexity**: Notebooks should be single-purpose, linear flow, readable in under 5 minutes
- **Documentation Strategy**: Comprehensive explanations in labeled markdown blocks, avoid repetition, use brief inline comments for code clarity
- **No Error Handling**: Skip complex error handling to keep focus on core concepts
- **No Backwards Compatibility**: Use modern Python and package versions only
- **Clean Code**: Prioritize readability and clarity over robustness

## Assumptions

1. **Target Audience**: Notebook creators who need to share content with colleagues, students, or clients
2. **Use Case**: Creating notebooks for others to consume, not just personal analysis
3. **Quality Standards**: Professional-grade notebooks that reflect well on the creator
4. **Collaboration**: Multiple people may contribute to or consume the notebooks
5. **Environment**: Users have conda/miniconda installed
6. **Git Knowledge**: Users understand basic git workflows
7. **Platform**: Primary development on Windows (based on file paths), but should work cross-platform
8. **Python Version**: Python 3.12 will be used
9. **Maintenance Context**: Notebooks need to remain functional and current over time
10. **Testing Approach**: pytest + nbmake for local testing, GitHub Actions for CI

## Open Questions

1. ~~**Testing Framework**: Should we use pytest, unittest, or demonstrate multiple approaches?~~ âœ… **Resolved**: pytest with nbmake
2. ~~**Notebook Complexity**: How complex should the example notebooks be to effectively demonstrate concepts?~~ âœ… **Resolved**: Minimal complexity - single-purpose notebooks with linear flow, simple data operations, readable in under 5 minutes
3. ~~**Documentation Level**: What level of inline documentation strikes the right balance between clarity and conciseness?~~ âœ… **Resolved**: Thorough topic coverage in labeled blocks, avoid repetition, brief inline comments only
4. ~~**Package Selection**: Which specific packages should be included in the conda environment beyond the basics and Azure SDK?~~ âœ… **Resolved**: Absolute minimum - essential tools only, most recent stable Azure SDK versions
5. ~~**Azure Services**: Which specific Azure AI Foundry services should be demonstrated in example notebooks?~~ âœ… **Resolved**: No Azure services in initial examples, only basic chat with Azure AI Foundry SDK and OpenAI model after authentication
6. ~~**GitHub Actions**: Should authentication testing be included in CI, or only notebook execution without Azure calls?~~ âœ… **Resolved**: Initial implementation excludes Azure authentication, add Azure authentication testing to GitHub Actions when implementing auth phase

## Step-by-Step Plan

### Phase 1: Repository Structure Setup âœ…

1. âœ… Create basic directory structure including `tests/` folder
2. âœ… Initialize git repository with appropriate .gitignore
3. âœ… Set up README.md with clear project description and usage instructions

### Phase 2: Environment Configuration âœ…

1. âœ… Create `requirements.txt` file for pip/venv environment
2. âœ… Include essential data science packages (pandas, numpy, jupyter, etc.)
3. âœ… Add development tools (nbconvert, pre-commit, pytest, nbmake)
4. âœ… **Exclude Azure packages initially**
5. âœ… Switch from conda to venv for lighter, faster setup

### Phase 3: Environment Variables Setup (Non-Azure) âœ…
1. âœ… Create `.env.template` file for general environment variables
2. âœ… Add `.env` to .gitignore
3. âœ… Demonstrate environment variable patterns without Azure credentials
4. âœ… Show inline environment variable loading in notebooks (no helper functions)

### Phase 4: Git Hooks and Notebook Cleaning âœ…
1. âœ… Set up pre-commit hooks configuration
