    "### 📝 When Git Hooks Run\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository uses two methods to clean notebook outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pre-commit hooks**: These run automatically when you make a `git commit` command, but **not** when you run `git add`. The pre-commit hooks in this repository:\n",
    "   - Remove notebook outputs and metadata (`nbstripout`)\n",
    "   - Fix whitespace and formatting issues\n",
    "   - Check for large files\n",
    "   - Validate YAML files\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Git filters**: The setup script also installs `nbstripout` as a Git filter using `nbstripout --install`. This configures Git to automatically clean notebook files during the staging process when you run `git add`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dual approach ensures notebooks are cleaned regardless of whether you use `git add` followed by `git commit` or just `git commit -am \"message\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up these hooks in your environment, run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# On Windows\n",
    "scripts\\setup_hooks.bat\n",
    "\n",
    "# On Mac/Linux\n",
